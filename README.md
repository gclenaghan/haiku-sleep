Allow SmartThings to automate turning on sleep mode on a Haiku fan

This is a device handler for a [Haiku Fan](https://www.bigassfans.com/for-home/). I tried using the [handler by System48](https://community.smartthings.com/t/haiku-fan-senseme-two-way-assistance/40204) but was unable to get it to work with the new app including automations. Instead of trying to replicate that really I just wanted to turn on sleep mode on the fan when the hub goes into Night mode. So this is a super simple handler with just a big button that turns on sleep. There is no other functionality, not even turning off sleep. The button can be pressed by an automation.

Enjoy.
